# frond

Frond attempts to accomplish the following list that I talked about in [my blog post](https://blog.usmanity.com/finding-a-good-theme-on-for-a-wordpress-blog-is-hard/):

   1. Prioritizes long form text, posts lacking photos still look good.
   1. Homepage displays blog posts as the primary content, no big images or homepage specific content.
   1. Top header is minimal and present on all pages but is not imposing.
   1. Has legible typography, uses the best readability styling on mobile, desktop, dark mode or light mode.
   1. Has a nav item that shows selected or all pages.
   1. Footer is minimal, post footer can have related posts.
   1. Specific content types are styled and covered, e.g. blockquotes have proper styling, code snippets have fixed font.
   1. Is free and open to contributions.


### leaf vs frond

This is an alternative to the [leaf theme](https://github.com/usmanity/leaf). Leaf attempted to be a simple theme with no overly designed elements, Frond takes this farther by adding only typography and content changes that I consider to be part of a good long form theme (see above).
